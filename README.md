### Welcome to the CRAIVE-Lab!

The Collaborative-Research Augmented Immersive Virtual Environment Laboratory (CRAIVE-Lab) is a multidisciplinary research group at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. We specialize in research in immersive rooms, or multi-user [room-oriented immersive systems (ROIS)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S000368702300114X?dgcid=author). Our immersive room combines human-scale panoramic virtual reality display, 136-channel spatial audio speaker system, occupant-aware motion sensing platform. Our research spans from human-scale architectural visualization, collaborative learning, immersive art, virtual acoustic rendering, and computational modeling of distributed human cognition.
